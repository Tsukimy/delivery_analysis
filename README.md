Please, open delivery_analysis.ipynb to look at the whole analysis

This is analysis with two parts based on two datasets
Structure
# 1. Food orders
Data exploration of food orders dataset (orders_autumn_2020.csv)
## 1.1 EDA 
Exploratory data analysis which allows to look at data overall
## 1.2 Location analysis 
Allows to learn more about location distribution among food orders
## 1.3 Time and weather analysis
## 1.4 EDA conclusion
## 1.5 Clusterization
Allows to see most order loaded locations
## 1.6 Prediction of the item's amount
Here I use Random Forest and XGBoost models and compare their results to predict how many items in a busket users order
## 1.7 What may I improve and suggest for future analysis?
Here I can develop it eternally
# 2. Daily activity analysis
Basically, here I try to predict amount of couriers using XGBoost and feature importance based on data I have (daily_cp_activity_dataset.csv)
